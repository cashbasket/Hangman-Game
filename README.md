# Don't Let Chuck Norris Kick You in the Face

Starting off a perfectly innocent game of "Hangman" meant to test my frontend JavaScript and HTML/CSS ability, **Don't Let Chuck Norris Kick You in the Face** became so much more. If you don't know anything about Chuck, it might be difficult for you; if you DO know about Chuck... it will probably still be difficult for you.

## How to Play

Playing the game is snap, assuming you know how to play "Hangman." All you have to do is press a letter or number key, and if that letter or number is contained in the answer, it will appear in the answer as it should.  If you guess something that is **not** contained in the answer, Chuck will become irritated, and he will start to make himself more and more apparent. If you guess incorrectly 10 times, Chuck will become furious, and you will be kicked in the face. Sorry.
