				<p>Don't be fooled; Chuck Norris is lurking around here somewhere. Just because you can't see him doesn't mean he isn't there.</p>
				<p>It's a well known fact that Chuck likes to kick stuff, but what you might not know is that Chuck absolutely HATES it when he comes up with a random word and people can't guess all the letters in the word. It makes him mad. Real mad. So mad, in fact, that when someone guesses a wrong letter <span class="strong red">10 times</span>, he kicks that someone in the face. You don't want that to happen to you.</p>
				<p>Do your best to guess the letters in Chuck's word, but beware: every time you guess incorrectly, Chuck knows about it, and he reveals himself a bit more. Once he's completely revealed, he WILL kick you in the face.</p>
				<p>Godspeed, brave warrior.</p>
